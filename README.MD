# [Your Work Day Scheduler](https://drkeck.github.io/Work-day-scheduler/)
this scheduler should help you iron out your work day by being able to add tasks, save task, dynamically track time, and show you when a tasks deadline might be coming up.

### notes
there is no support for mobile devices as of yet, many of the elements exist but a deadline had to be met first.

libreties with the pages design.
